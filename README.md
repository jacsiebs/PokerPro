# PokerPro
Instructuons to view and run the code (updated for iteration 2):

This includes the Unity project for iteration 2. The assets release 0.2 should be inserted to the directory /PokerPro_Nav_Testing to overwrite the existing assets folder. This was done in order to avoid committing several thousand changes each commit. After replacing the assets folder, open the project in Unity. This will require re-importing some assets, so it may take a few seconds to finish.
